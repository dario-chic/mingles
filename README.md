## Description


**Mingles**  is an educational and community-focused website designed to help people learn English effectively and for free. It was my first  **side project**, built with  **Next.js**, and it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. While the project didn't reach its full potential, it taught me invaluable lessons not only about coding but also about leadership, organization, and content creation.

The website features:

-   Informative articles written by me, displayed using  **Markdown**.
    
-   A community-driven approach to language learning.
    
-   Guides and resources based on professional research and polyglot methodologies.

_üí°This project was a turning point for me. It helped me grow not just as a developer but also as a leader and communicator. While it remains paused, I'm proud of what I accomplished and the skills I gained along the way._

## Main Features

### Informative Articles

The website features articles written by me, displayed using  **Markdown**. These articles cover topics like language learning methods, tips, and resources to help users improve their English skills.

### Community-Driven Learning

Mingles is designed to foster a sense of community among learners. Users can connect with others, share experiences, and support each other in their language-learning journey.

### Resourceful Guides

The  **School**  section provides guides based on professional research, personal experiences, and insights from top polyglots. These guides aim to teach users the most effective methods for learning languages.

### Simple and Intuitive Design

The website is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and minimalist interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need.
