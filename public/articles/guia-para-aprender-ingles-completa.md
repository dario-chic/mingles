# Aguacandy

Landing Page with a beautiful, simple, and minimal design for a local candy store. It's a simple website because it doesn't have too many functionalities, but for me, it's outstanding because of the responsive slider I coded for services/products.

It was simple but at the same time I think it was a difficult problem to solve

## Important Features

**Responsive Slider**

As a Landing Page, it doesn't have too many special features, but for this website, I developed one that I find interesting because while I was coding it I couldn't find anything like it on the web (StackOverflow ðŸ˜…) so I had to do it from scratch.

It's my "Responsive Slider", the main idea is to create two different views on different devices. A slider for mobile devices and a standard grid when the slider is too big.

After some time thinking about the flow and logic of the functionality, both programming and styling, I got my prototype. It worked, but switching between sliders was too hard and not at all smooth, not what I wanted. So by switching between classes and animations I was able to get a nice result.

I am now working on improving this functionality by adding more ways to switch between the sliders (instead of just right and left) and adding touch functionality to switch when the user touches the slider in one direction.
